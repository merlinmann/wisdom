# A Great First Layer

Observations on things I've learned about life from 3D printing.

By Merlin Mann

## Life

- Focus on your fundamentals. Every print needs a great first layer.
- Start by making small things and focus on process.
- You only control what your machines are instructed to do. Everything else is your fault. Which is okay, but you should definitely know that.
- Learn when and when not to experiment with applying more than one new change at a time.
  - Related: if you're having problems, it's probably because you're experimenting with applying more than one new change at a time.
- Everything you make will teach you something about making future things. This will always only ever make sense later. Which is fine.
- Information, knowledge, and wisdom are each cumulative. Your ideas about whether any two things are related or connected will adapt, correct, and evolve.
- At any given moment, you will be wrong about approximately half of what you think you know. And there's no way to know which half. Eventually, you will _almost_ get used to this.
- Avoid buying new gear if you mostly just need to work a little harder.
- Stay open to the unexpected ways that exposure to one domain might create, nurture, and develop your potential interest in a seemingly unrelated domain.
- Be careful of projects where one tiny error at the very end ruins everything.
  - Related: if a given project ends up being anything less than perfect, can you find any way to make your error more useful or skillful?
- Iterate with focus but without full commitment.

## 3D Printing, General Troubleshooting

- power cycle
- dry your filament
- choose, clean, and prepare the bed properly
- maintain a high quality nozzle
  - I use and highly recommend [DiamondBack nozzles](https://e3d-online.com/collections/diamondback-nozzles)
- re-calibrate
- isolate the problem

## 🎯 The Target Rule

Listen. Just especially when you're starting?

There are going to be a lot of potentially interesting models out there that I'd amorphously call *Yellow Zone Things*. You will develop your own expertise about addressing these choices on your own. But, here's the thing.

Regardless of your expertise, always print whatever keeps you motivated to keep getting better at this stuff. But, you'll eventually probably want to avoid printing anything whose functional equivalent you could just as easily buy at Target. 

Especially if that less *creative* approach would be way faster or way cheaper or way less likely to clog your nozzle.

Some Yellow Zone Things to watch out for:

- boxes, containers, and "organizers"
- trash cans
- most hand tools
  - especially where precision or durability matters
- shoes
- things you mostly like for being colorful models of somethings from a 2d medium
  - Just buy a "collectible" from a store like a person
