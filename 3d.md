# A Great First Layer

Observations on things I've learned about life from 3D printing.

By Merlin Mann

## Life

- Focus on your fundamentals. Every print needs a great first layer.
- Start by making small things and focus on process.
- You only control what your machines are instructed to do. Everything else is your fault. Which is okay, but you should definitely know that.
- Learn when and when not to experiment with applying more than one new change at a time.
    - Related: if you're having problems, it's probably because you're experimenting with applying more than one new change at a time.
- Everything you make will teach you something about making future things. This will always only ever make sense later. Which is fine.
- Information, knowledge, and wisdom are each cumulative. Your ideas about whether any two things are related or connected will adapt, correct, and evolve.
- At any given moment, you will be wrong about approximately half of what you think you know. And there's no way to know which half. Eventually, you will _almost_ get used to this.
- Avoid buying new gear if you mostly just need to work a little harder.
- Stay open to the unexpected ways that exposure to one domain might create, nurture, and develop your potential interest in a seemingly unrelated domain.
- Be careful of projects where one tiny error at the very end ruins everything.
    - Related: if a given project ends up being anything less than perfect, can you find any way to make your error more useful or skillful?
- _Iterate, iterate!_

## 3D Printing

- power cycle
- dry your filament
- clean the bed
- re-calibrate
- isolate the problem

### Print what you like, but

- Avoid printing things where the real-world version is more inexpensive, widely available, durable, and/or high-quality.
    - Print a trash can if it suits a very specific need, otherwise just use a regular trash can.
- next print thing TK

### Yellow Zone Things
